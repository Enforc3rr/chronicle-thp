# Chronicle [Take Home Project]

### About :
- Task of this application was to create a small scale document sharing platform which contains a user who can have four different roles :
  - Owner Of the document 
  - Read the document [decided by owner]
  - Edit and Share the document [decided by owner]
  - Does not have any permission at all [As the Part of bonus challenge such type of user can view public documents]
  
##### Note : 
  - Working of this project can be found out at `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BC_zTJjIU4dDyMmB937LMPrA_eahIqUf/view?usp=sharing` or can be viewed at bottom of this readme under Working heading.
  - Hosted at : ``
#### Bonus Challenge :
1) **Challenge =** Write API for getting all the documents that a user has access to, the documents that they created and the ones that are shared with them.   
   **Solution :**      
Proofs :

3) **Challenge =** Implement publicly viewable documents. Public documents can be viewed by anyone even if they donâ€™t have any access to the document. The access to private documents remains unchanged.  
**Solution :** Basically I included a field in document schema called `isPublicDocument` which takes in a boolean , if it's true then the document can be publicly viewed And this boolean value can be altered by the person who has created the document.   

### Schema :
- Document schema 
```
documentID : INT [Primary Key]
documentText : VARCHAR(255)
isPublicDocument : BOOLEAN
```
- User Schema
```
userEmail : VARCHAR(255) [Primary Key]
name : VARCHAR(255) 
```
